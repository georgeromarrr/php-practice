# Getting Started with this repository
This project was made to practice my php and bootstrap skills

## Steps

### 1. installing `XAMPP`
You can install it thru [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)!

### 2. accessing `XAMPP` root folder
After installing xampp, Go to `xampp` root folder and locate the `htdocs` folder.

### 3. `git clone`
Inside the `htdocs` folder, `git clone` this `repository`
    
### 4. setting-up the `XAMPP Apache Module`
Open your `XAMPP control panel` and `Start` the `Apache` service module

### 5. running the `PHP` in the browser
Open [localhost/php-practice/index.php](localhost/php-practice/index.php) to view it in your browser.


**Note: first `git clone` the repository inside the htdocs folder and make it sure that the `XAMPP Apache` is running. without doing this you won't be able to see your `PHP` inside the browser**
